# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Created a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function is a list containing 9 digits. The function converts the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and returns a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
